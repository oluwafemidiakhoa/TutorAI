## Architecture

TutorX-MCP implements a modular, layered architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability:

### Key Components

1. **MCP Server (mcp_server/server.py)**: 
   - Core FastAPI application that exposes educational tools and resources
   - Registers tools with the shared MCP instance
   - Provides HTTP endpoints and SSE transport for client connections

2. **Shared MCP Instance (mcp_server/mcp_instance.py)**: 
   - Central registration point for all MCP tools
   - Avoids circular import issues and ensures tool availability

3. **AI Model Integration (mcp_server/model/)**:
   - Integrates Google Gemini Flash models with automatic fallback mechanisms
   - Provides uniform interface for text generation and content structuring

4. **Tool Modules (mcp_server/tools/)**:
   - Modular implementation of educational features
   - Each tool is registered with the MCP instance via decorators
   - Designed for independent development and testing

5. **Resource Modules (mcp_server/resources/)**:
   - Manages educational data like concept graphs and curriculum standards
   - Provides data for adaptive learning and standards alignment

6. **Gradio Interface (app.py)**:
   - Web-based user interface
   - Communicates with the MCP server via the MCP client protocol

This separation of concerns allows:
- MCP clients (like Claude Desktop App) to directly connect to the MCP server via SSE transport
- The web interface to interact with the server using the MCP protocol
- Clear boundaries between presentation, API gateway, tool implementations, and resources
- Easy extension through the addition of new tool modules

For more detailed architecture information, see the documentation in the docs/ folder.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
uv install -e ".[test]"

# Run test suite
python run_tests.py
```
